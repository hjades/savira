    <div class="introduction">

        <h2>New Top-up Event</h2>
        <h3>Project Context</h3>
        <p>Recognizing the unique preferences of Indonesian players, I led a comprehensive project to redesign our top-up event. The initiative was built on extensive research into local gaming behaviors, particularly the affinity for probability-based gameplay such as gacha games and spinning wheel mechanics.</p>

        <h3>Strategic Approach</h3>
        <p>The project addressed critical challenges including low player retention by developing a nuanced approach. We created a free-to-play mechanism that simultaneously educated players about the event and encouraged continued engagement. Critically, we ensured all user interfaces were localized in Indonesian to enhance accessibility and user experience.</p>

        <h3>Project Results</h3>
        <div class="result-graphic">
            <p>Player Participation Rate: 85%</p>
            <div style="width: 85%; background-color: #4CAF50; height: 20px;"></div>
            
            <p>Event Retention Rate Increase: 45%</p>
            <div style="width: 45%; background-color: #2196F3; height: 20px;"></div>
            
            <p>Additional Impact: Attracted high-value players, resulting in increased daily revenue</p>

        <h2>Game User Interface Improvement</h2>
        <h3>Initial Challenge</h3>
        <p>The existing game interface presented significant usability barriers, particularly for the elderly demographic that comprises a substantial portion of our user base. Small fonts, complex icons, and intricate design elements created substantial user experience challenges.</p>

        <h3>Design Strategy</h3>
        <p>Our redesign prioritized clarity, intuitive navigation, and demographic-specific usability. We systematically enhanced visual accessibility by enlarging interactive elements, increasing button sizes, and simplifying visual components. This approach demonstrated our commitment to creating inclusive, user-friendly design solutions.</p>

        <h3>Quantitative Outcomes</h3>
        <div class="result-graphic">
            <p>Average Icon Click-Through Rate: 30%</p>
            <div style="width: 30%; background-color: #FF9800; height: 20px;"></div>
            
            <p>Side System Entry Rate Increase: 25%</p>
