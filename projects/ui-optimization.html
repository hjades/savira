                            <p>Our game lobby is the primary touchpoint for users to discover and select games.
                                Analytics revealed that users were spending less time in the lobby and engagement with
                                newer games was below target. This directly impacted our key business metrics: game
                                discovery, session time, and monetization opportunities.</p>
                            <p>This project aligned with our Q2 strategic initiative to improve discovery and session
                                metrics across our entire game portfolio.</p>

                                <li>Our primarily 45+ demographic found text and buttons too small</li>
                                <li>Visual hierarchy was unclear, causing cognitive overload</li>

                        <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> "The buttons are too small and I often press the wrong one.
                            There's too much happening on the screen, and I can't easily find my favorite games."</p>

                    <div class="tab-content active">
                        <h4>Solution Strategy</h4>
                        <p>We approached this redesign with three key principles:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility First:</strong> Designing for our older demographic meant
                                prioritizing larger touch targets, improved contrast, and simplified interactions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Creating clear distinction between primary actions
                                (game selection) and secondary actions (settings, profile) through size, color, and
                                position.</li>
                            <li><strong>Incremental Testing:</strong> Instead of a complete overhaul, we tested
                                individual elements with 10% of users to validate improvements before full
                                implementation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>I created a prioritization matrix to determine which UI elements would deliver the highest
                            impact relative to development effort, focusing our initial sprints on the highest-value
                            improvements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tab-content">
                        <h4>Design Process</h4>
                        <p>The redesign went through multiple iterations:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>User Journey Mapping:</strong> I worked with UX researchers to document the
                                current lobby navigation flow and identify friction points.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wireframing:</strong> Created low-fidelity mockups using Figma to test multiple
                                layout options.</li>
                            <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> Conducted remote testing sessions with 12 users across
                                different age groups using InVision prototypes.</li>
                            <li><strong>A/B Testing:</strong> Deployed three variants to test button size, placement,
                                and color schemes with real users.</li>
                            <li><strong>Iterative Refinement:</strong> Used heat mapping data to further optimize
                                placement of high-value elements.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <div class="tab-content">
                        <h4>Implementation Challenges</h4>
                        <p>The project faced several technical and organizational hurdles:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Technical Debt:</strong> The legacy codebase had inconsistent UI implementations
                                requiring significant refactoring.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross-Platform Considerations:</strong> Ensuring a consistent experience across
                                Android, iOS, and web versions required close collaboration with three different
                                development teams.</li>
                            <li><strong>Performance Concerns:</strong> Initial designs increased load times on older
                                devices. I worked with engineering to optimize asset loading and reduce initial render
                                time by 40%.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stakeholder Alignment:</strong> Marketing wanted to maintain prominent placement
                                for promotional content, which conflicted with our simplification goals. I conducted a
                                workshop to align on user-centered metrics that satisfied both teams' objectives.</li>
                        </ul>

                </div>

                <h4>My Strategic Contribution</h4>
                <ul class="contribution-list">
                    <li>Advocated for and secured executive buy-in by connecting UI improvements to business KPIs
                        (engagement, retention, monetization)</li>
                    <li>Created a data-informed prioritization framework to focus design and development resources on
                        highest-impact areas</li>
                    <li>Established a measurement plan with clear success metrics, tracking both leading indicators
                        (click-through rates) and lagging indicators (session time)</li>
                    <li>Led cross-functional collaboration between design, engineering, and QA teams to ensure cohesive
                        implementation</li>
                    <li>Implemented a phased rollout strategy to minimize risk and gather incremental feedback</li>
                    <li>Developed an A/B testing strategy to validate improvements before full deployment</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Small UX improvements can drive significant business impact when focused on critical user
                        journeys</li>
                    <li>Cross-functional alignment is crucial - success required shared understanding across design,
                        engineering, and business teams</li>
                    <li>Progressive enhancement is more effective than complete redesigns for maintaining user comfort
                        while improving experience</li>
                    <li>Cultural considerations matter - Indonesian users had different navigation preferences than
